CHAPTER I.
  106 The Period
  107 
  108 
  109 It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
  110 wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
  111 was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
  112 season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
  113 despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were
  114 all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in
  115 short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its
  116 noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
  117 evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

  119 There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
  120 throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
  121 a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
  122 than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
  123 that things in general were settled for ever.
  124 
  125 It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
  126 Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
  127 as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
  128 blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
  129 heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
  130 made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
  131 ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
  132 messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
  133 deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
  134 earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
  135 from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
  136 to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
  137 communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
  138 brood.
